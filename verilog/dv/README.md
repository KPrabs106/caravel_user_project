# Simulation Environment Setup


You will need to build the RV32I toolchain. Firstly, export the installation path for the RV32I toolchain, 

```bash
export GCC_PATH=<gcc-installation-path>
```

Then, run the following: 

```bash

sudo mkdir $GCC_PATH
sudo chown $USER $GCC_PATH

git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain riscv-gnu-toolchain-rv32i
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain-rv32i
git checkout 411d134
git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir build; cd build
../configure --with-arch=rv32i --prefix=$GCC_PATH
make -j$(nproc)
```

# Running Simulation

You will need to export these environment variables: 

```bash
export GCC_PATH=<gcc-installation-path>
export PDK_PATH=<pdk-location/sky130A>
```


## GCD Test

This test compares the result of the GCD hardware with a software implementation.

You can run the GCD test with:

```bash
make verify-gcd
```
